     * Write a method hasEqualSum with 3 parameters of type int.
     *
     * The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the sum of
     * the first and second parameter is equal to the third parameter. Otherwise,
     * return false.
     *
     *
     *
     * EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:
     *
     * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 1); should return false since 1 + 1 is not equal to 1
     *
     * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 2); should return true since 1 + 1 is equal to 2
     *
     * hasEqualSum(1, -1, 0); should return true since 1 + (-1) is 1 - 1 and is
     * equal to 0
     *
     *
     *
     * NOTE: The hasEqualSum method needs to be defined as public static â€‹like we
     * have been doing so far in the course.
     * NOTE: Do not add a main method to solution code.
     * The objective of this coding exercise is to write a small program that checks
     * if the sum of two numbers are equal to a third number.
