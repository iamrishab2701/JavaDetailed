     * Shared Digit
     * Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int.
     *
     * Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If
     * one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.
     *
     * The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both
     * numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false.
     *
     *
     *
     * EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
     *
     * hasSharedDigit(12, 23); → should return true since the digit 2 appears in
     * both numbers
     *
     * hasSharedDigit(9, 99); → should return false since 9 is not within the range
     * of 10-99
     *
     * hasSharedDigit(15, 55); → should return true since the digit 5 appears in
     * both numbers
     *
     *
     *
     * NOTE: The method hasSharedDigit​ should be defined as public static like we
     * have been doing so far in the course.
     *
     * NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
     *
     * The objective of this coding exercise is to write a small program that checks
     * if there's a digit that appears in both numbers.
