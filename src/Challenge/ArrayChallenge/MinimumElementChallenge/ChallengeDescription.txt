1. Write a method called readIntegers, that reads a comma delimited list of numbers, entered by the user from the console, and then returns an array, containing those numbers that were entered.

2. Next, write a method called findMin, that takes the array as an argument, and returns the minimum value found in that array.

3. In the main method
    - Call the method readIntegers, to get the array of integers from the user, and print these out, using a method found in java.util.Arrays.
    - Next call the findMin method, passing the array, returned from the call to the readIntegers method.
    - Print the minimum element in the array, which should be returned from the findMin method.

4. A tip here. Assume that the user will only enter numbers - so you don't need to do any validation for the console input.
