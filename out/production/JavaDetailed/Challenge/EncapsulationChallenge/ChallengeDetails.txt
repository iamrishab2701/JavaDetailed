In this challenge you need to create a class named Printer

The fields on this class are going to be:

- tonerLevel, which is the percentage of how much toner level is left.
- pagesPrinted, which is the count of total pages printed by the Printer.
- duplex, which is a boolean indicator. If true, it can print on 2 sides of a single sheet of paper.

You'll want to initialize your printer, by specifying a starting toner amount, and whether the printer is duplex or not.

On the Printer class, you want to create two methods, which the calling code should be able to access.

These methods are:

- addToner() which takes a tonerAmount argument
    - tonerAmount is added to the tonerLevel field.
    - The tonerLevel should never exceed 100 percent, or ever get below 0 percent.
    - If the amount being added makes the level fall outside that range, return a -1 from the method, otherwise return
      the actual toner level
- printPages() which should take pages to be printed as the argument.
    - It should determine how many sheets of paper, will be printed based on the duplex value, and return this sheet
      number from the method.
    - The sheet number should also be added to the pagesPrinted variable.
    - If it's a duplex printed, print a message that it's a duplex printer.
